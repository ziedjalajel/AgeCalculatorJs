// Create three functions. checkParamsFn, checkOverEighteenFn & calculateAgeFn.
// The first function checks your parameters and returns
// true if all of them are integers, whereas returns false if not.
// The second function is self explanatory.
// The third function, uses the first and second functions to check its inputs
// and returns an error message that starts with "error:"
// This function should return a rounded age.

// HINT: recycling code is never bad practice.

// This functions should check the integrity of the parameters and pass true/false
function checkParamsFn(year, month, day) {
  // Write your code here
}

// This functions should check if the person is or above 18 years of age, return true/false
function checkOverEighteenFn(year, month, day) {
  // Write your code here
}

// This is an anonymous function. It looks like a variable but it's not.
// Also look at the naming of the function. it looks like salwaBaqer, where
// the first letter of the first word is small, while the first letter of the
// second word is Capital. This is called "Camel Casing."
// Also the Fn at the end of the function name is short for function.
// str = String, int = Integer, arr = Array, obj = Object, fn = Function
// It's best practice to name your function as to what it does, or your variable
// to what it holds.
function calculateAgeFn(year, month, day) {
  // Write your code here
}

module.exports = calculateAgeFn;
